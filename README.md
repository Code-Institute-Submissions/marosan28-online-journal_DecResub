## UX 

### User Stories
#### Users
1. As a **user** I want to **log in the topic I have interest in** as a **way of tracking and revisiting information.**
2. As a **site user** I can **add a new topic** about a subject I'm interested in. 
3. **I can view a post's entirety** as a **site user** by **clicking on it.**
4. As a **site user** I can **delete** entries.
5. As a **site user** I can **edit the entries I've previously added.**
6. As a **site user** I can **login to the website with the username and password I used for registration.** 
7. I can **create** an account as a **user** of the site.

#### Site Admin:
1. As a **site Admin** I can **restrict access to Topics page.**

### Design

 #### Colour Scheme
 
- [The colour palette used on this website is:](https://coolors.co/9e5e2a-f5f5dc-000000-ffffff-c4c4c4 'Color Palete')

    - Colors chosen are soft so the user is able to enter and read data with minimal distractions. 
    - The color scheme is made to be minimalistic.

#### Typography

The *Sura* font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback. *Sura* is used because of the roundness and softness of the letters while maintainig the professional look. It's perfect for a casual environment but also not too formal.
