# Online Journal

Welcome to the Online Journal app! This is a functional website that allows you to keep track of the topics you are reading and learning about.

This app is built with Django, a powerful web framework for Python. It is part of a full stack portfolio project with Code Institute, designed to showcase your skills as a full stack developer.

With the Online Journal app, you can easily add and track the topics you are learning about, as well as make notes and comments on your progress. Whether you're a student, professional, or lifelong learner, this app is a great tool for staying organized and motivated.

### Design

 #### Colour Scheme
 
- [The colour palette used on this website is:](https://coolors.co/9e5e2a-f5f5dc-000000-ffffff-c4c4c4 'Color Palete')

    - Colors chosen are soft so the user is able to enter and read data with minimal distractions. 
    - The color scheme is made to be minimalistic.

#### Typography

The *Sura* font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback. *Sura* is used because of the roundness and softness of the letters while maintainig the professional look. It's perfect for a casual environment but also not too formal.
